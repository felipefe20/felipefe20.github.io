### Hello
Hello, I'm Felipe Fernandez, a Data Scientist Engineer at the intersection of data engineering and machine learning. I thrive on making data valuable to end-users, whether by building robust data pipelines, crafting machine learning models, or implementing cutting-edge MLOps practices. My goal is to leverage this expertise to excel as a Machine Learning Engineer, constantly learning and implementing new tools and best practices in the field.


### My Work and Interests
In my work and projects, I demonstrate a strong passion for data and a commitment to innovation. I am proficient in a wide array of data analysis tools, including Python, PySpark, R, Web Scraping, SQL, MLOps, Airflow, Prefect, Scikit-learn, AzureML, and more, constantly seeking to expand my skill set.

Currently, I am focused on learning and implementing new tools such as Kafka, NoSQL, DataBricks, Redshift, BigQuery, dbt, OpenCV, and Pytorch. These efforts reflect my dedication to staying updated with the latest technologies and my enthusiasm for exploring new avenues in data analysis and machine learning.

In MLOps practices, I have experience with mlflow, Dagshub, DVC, FastAPI, and GitHub Actions. I also have expertise in various databases, including SQL Server, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL, and a strong background in ETL processes using tools like Databricks, Spark, Kafka, Airflow, Prefect, Mage, dbt, and dlt.

I am proficient in working with cloud platforms such as GCP, AWS, Azure, and Terraform, with a particular focus on BigQuery. In machine learning, I have expertise in Azure ML, NLP, Deep Learning, Vertex AI, Computer Vision, Scikit-learn, and PyCaret. For data visualization, I utilize Power BI, Tableau, Streamlit, Seaborn, and Matplotlib.

My toolkit also includes Python, R, Git, Web Scraping, Docker, Selenium, Beautiful Soup, Pandas, regex, and NLTK. This diverse skill set reflects my belief in the power of data and my continuous exploration of new technologies to maximize its potential.

### My Education
I hold a Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering from Bogot√°, Colombia and a PostGraduate diploma in Big Data Analytics from Toronto, Canada.

### My Hobbies
Besides learning and studying, I enjoy reading, watching movies, learning French and getting out with my family and friends, and on top of that is play time with my daughter
